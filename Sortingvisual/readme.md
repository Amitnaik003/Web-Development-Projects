Project Overview:
The Sorting Visualizer provides a graphical representation of sorting algorithms like:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort (if included)
Features:
User Input: Allows users to generate a random array of numbers.
Algorithm Selection: Users can choose a sorting algorithm from a menu.
Visualization: Animates the sorting process step by step.
Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of visualization.
Restart/Shuffle: Provides options to restart the sorting or shuffle the array.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and animations for better visualization.
JavaScript: Implements sorting algorithms and handles UI interactions.
How It Works:
A set of bars (representing array elements) is generated.
When an algorithm is selected, the bars are sorted step by step.
The sorting process is animated, showing comparisons and swaps.
This project is a great way to demonstrate your front-end development skills and understanding of sorting algorithms. If you need to refine or expand it, you can add more algorithms, enhance UI/UX, or even use React.js for better performance. ðŸš€
